# Building a RESTful Web Service

A key difference between a traditional MVC controller and the RESTful web service controller shown earlier is the way that the HTTP response body is created. Rather than relying on a view technology to perform server-side rendering of the greeting data to HTML, this RESTful web service controller populates and returns a `Greeting` object. The object data will be written directly to the HTTP response as JSON.
